    summary: |
      Highly talented engineer with many years of experience in distributed
      systems, web systems, cloud platforms, opensource sofware and even some
      artifical intelligence mixed in (a master of some). I am always looking
      to learn and develop new technologies, patterns and tooling and
      enjoy helping others (junior and senior) become all that they can
      be. Overall I am looking for cloud and distributed
      systems experience at scale (possibly even some artifical intelligence
      applications thrown in for good measure) and enjoy working with smart
      and talented other engineers and even some management as needed ;)
