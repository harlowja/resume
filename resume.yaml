    summary: |
      Highly talented engineer with many years of experience in distributed
      systems, web systems, cloud platforms, opensource sofware and even some
      artifical intelligence mixed in (a master of some). I am always looking
      to learn and apply new technologies, new patterns and build systems
      and tooling (especially at scale). I enjoy helping others (junior
      and senior) become all that they can be and am happy (and willing
      and able) to lead others as needed. Overall I am looking for cloud
      and distributed systems experience at scale (possibly even some
      artifical intelligence applications thrown in for good
      measure) and enjoy working with smart and talented other engineers
      and even some management as needed ;)
